# Tactical Theorems and Frameworks '06

## Frameworks

Having taken all that on board, let us have a look at some mentality frameworks in a more systematic manner. Personally, I use the Rule of Two, as detailed above, but I have also had success employing the 5x5 Defensive Line. The third mentality system, the Split Global, is theoretical only and has not been tested, but I see no reason why it shouldn’t work. Finally, there is the option of using a Pure Global mentality, but I feel it limits user advantages, as detailed above.

### The Rule of Two

The Rule of Two is based upon the assumption that players must have a variety of acceptable passing options available to them. If players are too close together they are too easy to contain, and passing breaks down. If players are too far apart, too many ambitious balls are hit, and passing breaks down. Therefore, each player must be able to pick out someone to pass too who has a mentality within two positions of his own.

Thus, in a 4-4-2 normal tactic, the system would run as follows:

DCs: Mentality = 6

FBs: Mentality = 10

MCd: Mentality = 8

MR/L: Mentality = 12

MCa: Mentality = 16

FC: Mentality = 14

ST: Mentality = 18

Overall Mentality: 112

This is an attacking system with the aggregate mentality being +12 above neutral. It is therefore likely to concede slightly higher than average, but score more as well. Its main strength lies in having high mentality forwards who are always open for clearance passes.

Style: The system follows a Chelsea-esque mode of play. Passing is relatively direct (see Mirroring) so intricate pass and move plays are rare. It does allow a fair degree of creative freedom up front though, so spectacular goals from range or quality strikes after scintillating dribbles happen with reasonable regularity. If set up correctly the user will see plenty of possession across the defence when playing at home, with plenty of movement around the box as the front five look for space, resulting in probing raids as and when opportunities present themselves. In away games there is a lot emphasis on counter-attacking moves that exploit the channels. At home the defensive line is deep but presses heavily. Away the defensive line is high but presses much less.

Mentality Experiments: I would argue against experimenting too much, but the system could be made highly attacking by upping mentality by 2 across the board. Likewise, dropping by 2 would make it defensive and by 4 ultra-defensive. I haven’t tried either so take no responsibility if they don’t work. If you wish to play around with any of the experimental approaches please post your results.

### 5x5 Defensive Line

5x5 Defensive Line Theory assumes that teams have a basic philosophy of five attack and five defend. Originally, the thinking here was that 5 players should have an equal defensive mentality, and five should have can equal attacking mentality. There were problems employing this type of system as there were big gaps between the attacking players and defensive players. The solution was to ensure the defensive line setting was equal to the mentality of the attacking players. Thus, attacking mentality is 15, defensive line is 15.

DCs: Mentality = 5

FBs: Mentality = 5

MCd: Mentality = 5

MR/L: Mentality = 15

MCa: Mentality = 15

FC: Mentality = 15

ST: Mentality = 15

Overall Mentality: 100

This is a neutral system that balances attack and defence perfectly. It has similar strengths to the Rule of Two framework in that it offers high mentality forwards who are looking to break quickly.

Style: The system follows an Arsenal-esque style of play. As five players are on high mentality and thus play close together the team is likely to try intricate pass and move plays. Equally, like the Arsenal, they have a solid defensive base protected by a defensive minded midfielder. If set up correctly the user should see a tight unit that attacks and defends en masse whilst drawing pretty footballing patterns. It should also be effective on the counter. However, it requires a high defensive line at all times and therefore may struggle against ultra-defensive systems.

Mentality Experiments: There are two ways to experiment. One is to higher or lower mentality across the board. The other is to keep to the combined mentality of 20 split and increase or narrow the gap between the mentalities (5-15 becomes 3-17 or 7-13). Please post results of any experiments.

N.B. Early testing on ’07 suggests that d-lines of above 14 are risky.

### Split Global

This was an experimental philosophy that Sir Bobby and I were discussing towards the end of my 06 playing days. It is really Sir Bobby’s baby, and I am not sure how far he got in his testing, but I thought it worthy of inclusion, as it offers a logical alternate system to the above. I’m sure he would like to hear about any successful trials with it.

DCs: Mentality = 6

FBs: Mentality = 10

MCd: Mentality = 10

MR/L: Mentality = 10

MCa: Mentality = 10

FC: Mentality = 14

ST: Mentality = 14

Overall Mentality: 100

This is a neutral system that balances attack and defence perfectly. It has been conceived as a more cautious alternative to the 5x5 Defensive Line theory and is mainly a slow build, risk free system.

Style: This system follows a Bolton-esque style of play. Most of the team employ a mentality midway between attack and defence and players contribute equally to both. Only four outfield players do specific jobs (DCs and FCs) but the mid-level mentality of the rest of the tem means they will be supported in their tasks.

Mentality Experiments: Raise by 2, 4 or 6 throughout for attacking to ultra-attacking systems, or drop by 2, 4 or 6 to become defensive or ultra-defensive.

### Pure Global

This system can be attacking, neutral or defensive, depending on the mentality settings. Personally, I wouldn’t advocate going higher than 15 or lower than 5. Pure Global is difficult to get working well but if you apply the following theorems you should be able to design a decent Pure Global tactic.
