## Q & A Rashidi

Mentality:

-Player instructions overrule team instructions.

True but only on extreme sets.

-Main uses are to give shape, positioning and movement to team.

Yes it does, but the adding of arrows can have dramatic effects. The effects are now more apparent for barrows for example. If you set a player with barrows, he will now track back even further, great if you want to play backs to the wall. But bad if you want to pass your way to the front

-Connects closely to formation, width and DL.

Mentality affects the shape of a formation, if you set everyone on the same mentality you can't tell the difference, but one you start sticking high mentalities on some, you will notice they take up different positons on the pitch, the passes they play are also affected. Having distinct groups of people on mentality is always a good idea.

Width seems to affect your stance, attacking or defensive, BUT this is formation specific. Formations like 433 and 343 even when set on narrow width settings still over great options for attacking. Width helps if your team is poor at passing too, cos it reduces the range for passing. Defensive Line is a bit strange. In theory a DL of high and low should translate easily in the game. However it does not. The only thing I can say is that perhaps higher DL makes the midfield and defense come closer, but this is very minor since mentality has a more drastic effect. You can play the same DL settings and still be successful. When playing against a good side, you can have a low to normal dl and still press heavily to win the ball.

-Influenced by or influences Tempo, Width and Passing Style.

Tempo can work with short passing and direct passing. Both can be successful, it depends on your shape. A 442 can be created to be ala "Arsenal" or it could be set up like Boltons, you can do both. How you make it work, is all dependant on your player instructions. If you want to employ short and quick tempo, like Arsenal, then a formation with 3 groups of mentality settings : 6-8 for DCs 8-10 for FBs..10-12 for midfield and 13-15 for attackers, set DLine to 8 and take off RWB from the whole team except for one striker. The team will tick tock the ball at light speed to the front line. To make it even more effective give one of the striker RWB Max and tell the other to cross ball often, it will wreak havoc in a defense.

You can create counterattacking tactics in the same vein too. Its wholly dependant on the type of formation you're playing. I've learnt to use an attacking 343 in my game and I do not get flanked as much as I did with the demo, precisely because of my judicious use of player instructions[/b]

Creative Freedom:

-More means players are more likely to take other instructions lightly, and vice versa.

-Mainly influences other instructions, and is not influenced by any.

-Affects Passing, CD, Tackling(?), FR, RwB, LS, TB, CB and FR(?) & HuB(?)

-Thus only to be used on AMC's, MR/L's, Wingers and Forwards?

-Helps create space if players are potent enough (on wide Width?)

CF just means how much a player will adhere to your instructions. So if you have a player with high CF and he is your designated corner kick taker and you have told him to aim for the post, he will not listen to you. If a player has high cf and you give it to a defender and you tell him to tightmark "A" he may tightmark the keeper cos he feels horny.

It affects everything from passing, positioning, runs, shooting, defending and toilet breaks. Use only if you have too. And its highly advisabe to use the in conjunction with player swapping for wingers and strikers if you are using a very attacking formation. I've gone from an average of 8 to 15 shots on goal now, but again it is tempered by decisions, teamwork and workrate. If a player is given high CF and he has low workrate, its not a good move.

Passing Style:

-Relates to Formation, Tempo, Width, DL.

-And here's a pop-up-as-Ãƒ-am-writing-thought:how about having MR/L's with long passing, no runs, and often crossing? Any ideas, theory or tested, on this?

Depends on the kind of football you want to play, possession football = short, slow tempo. Gunners =Short/quick tempo, perhaps even narrow width. If you want to play 'Pool, short/normal tempo/direct passing on flanks and high closing down all over the pitch. No one set way of playing, but its the combos that are tough to set up. The game handles these formations well 442 Diamond at normal tempo/narrow and wide with both short passing and high tempo...the 4132, the 442, and the 343.

Tempo:

-Higher means more shots and less possession, lower would thus mean less shots, more possession...

-Affects Passing and is Influenced by Passing.

-There is, I think, a huge difference between playing a normal side or a counter-attacking side?

-Taken into consideration setting this you would have to look at a players ability as well, mainly decisions etc.

Yes and No, to say tempo is the prime reason why would be false, its tempered by workrate, the formation you've set up, the closing down instructions and the form of passing you use. I can have a fast tempo formation with a low quality shot count formation too. But that kind of formation would be narrow. I can't really say anything about counterattacking since i don't believe you need those tactics. I good attacking tactic can also switch to counter attacking, all you need to do is to drop the DLine, and have direct passing already built into the tactic. So you could play a game of possession football for 120 minutes and hit a really good side with a sucker punch late in the game. I have a pkm that can prove this.

Width:

-Always wide at home, to create the space to be able to tear them apart...

-Normal against equal or weaker sides, narrow against stronger sides playing away.

If you are a poor side and you play with high width you'l also get torn apart. I believe you need balance. Increasing width helps create more chances, but it also elevates the risk of being punched through the centre. Having width at normal should be enough for all teams. Narrow to normal for poor sides. If you want to attack them on the counter..bring down the DLine, but don't change your width. If you have farrows in your formation, this may not work as you get pulled apart. So the balance with closing down has to be right. Which is why I am a firm advocate of CDs which close down high in front, sometimes high in midfield and low at the back or...high at the back and in front but low in the middle. It depends on the kind of footy you want

Closing Down:

-Can be used in varied ways, not sure what to say here, I always apply 5x5 rule in most of my games (5 players on 15, 5 players on 5, or 16/14, 17/13, 18/2, never the other way around though...).

I don't think this works as well as my way of closing down. I prefer aggressive closing down in front.

Time Wasting:

-Used to be handy to get more possession.

[/b]not anymore[/b]

Defensive Line:

-Deep doesn't go well.

-Neither does Push Up.

-Thus leaving it in the middle makes most sense to me, meaning no matter you're playing stronger or weaker sides, are better playing or outplayed, and counter or get countered, it's always just right.

-Leaving it deep gives opposition more possession, while moving it up means you'll have less space, thus less options, thus less possession.

-Moving it up can get them to counter easier, then you can Offside Trap them, which doesn't really work, it seems.

[/b]Covered that earlier[/b]

And I also came up with a theorie about Home and Away tactics, how about they mirror each other, mostly...anyone tried this or has any thoughts on this?

And how about FB's with barrows or even dbarrows? Maybe this will work against the lots of crosses against problem?

Won't work, barrows will mean they go further back..you want them to close down earlier don't you.
