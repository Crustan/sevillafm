# Tactical Theorems and Frameworks '06

## Future Testing

Man-Marking: I would love to know if man-marking works properly now. I really want to employ it and think that it could seriously add to tactical quality, but in 06 I didn’t trust it. Any posts on the viability of man-marking would be vastly appreciated.

Tackling: I leave everybody on normal. I am sure a specialised tackling system would make a more complete defensive system. Any ideas on tackling would be very well received.

Closing Down: I am aware of different closing down systems to my own, especially systems in which the defence stands off whilst the midfield presses and reduces space. If anyone has a system like that working with any of my frameworks I would be interested in hearing about it. Likewise, if anyone is using a system in which the FCs press opposing DCs into making mistakes.

Mirroring/Slider Pairings: If anyone has any further ideas about how to mirror or combine sliders please post them.

Team Talks: Any analysis on Pre-Game Team Talks appreciated.

Opposition Instructions: Any information on the effectiveness of utilising this option also appreciated.

Five-Ten-Fifteen: I design tactics (mainly) based on a 5-10-15 slider relationship. As early reports suggest slider effects are more obvious in 07, this ratio may need adjusting. Any comments welcome.

AI Mentality: Sir Bobby did a huge amount of testing on the AI mentality in ‘06 and concluded that it was Pure Global. This may have changed in ’07. Any ideas on this more than welcome.
