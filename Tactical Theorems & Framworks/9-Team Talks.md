# Tactical Theorems and Frameworks '06

## Team Talks

Finally, here is a short guide to team talks (half-time and full-time only)

### Home Team Talks

I would suggest pleased when winning by 2-3 clear goals at home and encourage at 1-0 or 0-0 but in control. Disappointing for a 0-0 when you are performing below expectations and angry when losing unless commentary says 'Your team is unlucky to be behind' when you should employ the 'we can win this option'. Thrilled when 4-0 up.

At full-time 'good result' for any home win of less than 4 clear goals. 4-0 or above 'fantastic'. 0-0 disappointed and for a loss 'angry' or 'disappointed' depending on performance. Sympathise if you were outclassed.

N.B. Occasionally, your team will not play to expectations at home and your attacking tactic will get picked apart. You should be able to see this happening very early on in the game via the match stats screen or highlights. Revert to your most defensive system to minimise first half damage. B*ll*ck the team at half-time! Start the second half with your attacking formation and you should see a massively improved level of performance.

### Away Team Talks

Pleased when winning 1 or 2-0. Delighted at 3-0. Encourage/we can win this at 0-0 or 0-1 if you are playing well. Disappointing for the same score lines if playing badly. Angry at 2-0 down.

At full-time pleased for a 1-0, 2-0 win or a draw against a quality side. Disappointed for a loss and average performance. Angry for a loss and dreadful performance. Fantastic for a 3-0 win and above.

NB: These options should be reassessed when used against high-performing and low-performing opposition. Obviously a 0-0 draw away to a top 3 team is a good result, whereas away to a bottom three team should be regarded as a disappointment. Tweak the options slightly depending on opposition and quality of your team.
