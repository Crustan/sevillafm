# Tactical Theorems and Frameworks '06

## Theorems

Having looked at three tactic building frameworks, it is now time to delve deeper into some of the other theories behind successful tactical set ups. The following section looks at Mirroring, Defensive Line, Farrows/Sarrows/Barrows, Mentality, Through-Balls, Forward Runs, Run With Ball, Crosses, Hold Up Ball, and Marking. All have been tested successfully with the RoT framework, but not with the 5x5 or Split Global.

### Slider Pairings/Mirroring

Mirroring basically means ensuring two opposing elements of the game have a slider total of 20. I experimented with mirroring heavily during my last three months on FM06 but didn’t ever get around to writing it up. There are many ways in which to mirror, and the following offers some suggestions.

#### Width versus Time Wasting

The assumption for this mirror is that a home tactic should be wide with low time wasting whereas an away tactic should be narrow with high time wasting. Thus, the mirroring split is:

Home: Width 15 vs. Time Wasting 5

Away: Width 5 vs. Time Wasting 15

I always use the 5/15 split as a starting point as they correspond with the ‘first notch’ of the sliders. Thus 5 is ‘first notch’ rarely and 15 is ‘first notch’ often. From this position attacking can be emphasised via lowering time wasting and raising width by the same factor. Likewise, defence can be emphasised by moving the sliders in the other direction.

NB: I rarely had to alter sliders from the ‘first notch’ position. Occasionally, I went to a 17-3 split if I was chasing a late goal, but I have never tested emphasising defence.

#### Creative Freedom versus Closing Down

I was having so much success with the Width/Time Wasting split that I decided to try it on a player by player basis. I built a tactic on a CF/CD split in individual instructions. The system looked like so:

DCs: Creative Freedom/Closing Down = 3/17

FBs: Creative Freedom/Closing Down = 5/15

MCd: Creative Freedom/Closing Down = 5/15

ML/R: Creative Freedom/Closing Down = 10/10

MCa: Creative Freedom/Closing Down = 15/5

FCs: Creative Freedom/Closing Down = 15/5

NB: I only tried this system at home. For away games I went for CD of 5 across the board (CF as above system) with the exception of the MCd who remained at 15. However, there is no reason it shouldn’t work (see Level Assumptions before deciding to employ such a system in LLM).

#### Mentality versus Passing

The Width/Time Wasting and the Creative Freedom/Closing Down mirrors worked so well that I decided to experiment with Passing/Mentality. My assumption was that DCs would benefit from direct passing, whereas a high mentality attacker only needs to play quick flicks. Following the RoT framework I devised the following.

DCs: Mentality/Passing = 6/14

FBs: Mentality/Passing = 10/10

MCd: Mentality/Passing = 8/12

MR/L: Mentality/Passing = 12/8

MCa: Mentality/Passing = 16/4

FC: Mentality/Passing = 14/6

ST: Mentality = 18/2

The results were very impressive. There is an argument for transposing the passing of the MCa and the FCd if you wish.

NB: This passing system was designed for High Quality sides. For Championship - high L2 I would suggest raising passing by 2 across the board so the mentality/passing total equals 22. For LLM raise by 4 so the total = 24 (see Level Assumptions). The GK should always pass to 2 higher than the DCs, no matter what mentality setting you use.

#### Tempo and Front Three Creative Freedom

There is evidence emerging in the Demo that tempo and front three (FCs & AMC/MCa) creative freedom should be matched. Therefore, if tempo is at 5 then CF for the front three should also be 5. If tempo is 15 then CF should be 15. The following reason seems to apply.

5/15 and 15/5 tempo/CF systems don't work as well, or look as good, because the two variables don't compliment each other. If tempo is high then players will look to move the ball around quickly and get it further upfield sooner. This is hindered by the 3 forward players not being allowed to stray from position, which is required in order for them to create spaces into which to pass the ball.

A slow tempo means players won't rush with passing and hold the ball up a lot. When making a pass players will try to keep it simple. This is complimented by players staying in their own positions. Therefore, the 5/5 and 15/15 systems work more effectively.

There are two things to take into consideration here. Firstly, there is the degree of tiredness players will suffer if they are playing high tempo football all match. Tempo/CF at 15/15 with all attacking players on high forward runs often will lead to fatigue. Therefore, high CF/high temp systems need to be employed realistically (circa Arsenal in their fast-fast-slow style). Secondly, it obviously influences the mirroring of CF/CD when applied to attacking players. Further testing is needed (see Future Testing/Closing Down).

N.B. It may be that a 5/15 tempo/CF split works well in a counter attacking system although a lot more testing is required.

#### Defensive Line

The assumption for the defensive line is that a high defensive line keeps your team close together and is thus ideal for away games. A high defensive line should be equal to the mentality of your most attacking midfielder. However, if you are using a DMC then it should drop by at least 2 notches from that setting or the DMC will get dragged too close to the d-line and fail to perform adequate covering duties.

A low defensive line is important when you are playing ultra-defensive systems such as the dreaded 3-3-2-1-1. In such systems the opposition FC plays very deep and a deep defensive line will ensure that the FC is covered by the DMC/MCd. The DCs will stop him if he gets past the DMC, but in general the DMC will win the ball or force a hurried clearance which is mopped up by the DCs. They are in a lot of space so have plenty of passing options available to recycle the ball back into the attacking third of the pitch. If the d-line is too high they won’t have easy options as they are covering the FC and too much time will be wasted in trying to win the ball back for them to be able to play easy passes into space (see Breaking Down the 3-3-2-1-1).

#### Farrows/Sarrows/Barrows

My preferred system is a 4-4-2 Diamond so I’ll use that as a guide. These rules should be pretty much transferable to any formation with a little thought.

Ultra-Attack: Long farrowed ML/R, Short farrowed FBs. This farrowing combination allows the wide players to double up on the defending side. If it is working you will see a lot of crosses nodded in at the far post by the corresponding winger.

Attack: Long farrowed ML/R. This allows for constant pressure on the opposition whilst maintaining a tighter defensive base.

Possession: Short farrowed ML/R, short barrowed AMC. This ensures a box-like structure around the opposition penalty area but remains more focussed on possession than on creating chances.

Defend Lead: Sarrowed FCs: Combined with a tight defensive system sarrowed FCs offer plenty of opportunities to exploit the channels. If the AI is pushing its FBs forward expect a host of counter-attacking chances.

NB: I also play an alternate 4-2-3-1 system that has long farrowed ML/R. On paper it looks more defensive than the Defend Lead system, but it actually focuses on getting four players forward (FC, AMC, ML/R) whereas the Defend Lead only attacks with three (FCs, AMC). I regarded this as a counter-attacking system, with settings combining Attack and Defend Lead.

### Forward Runs, Through-Balls, Run With Ball and Crosses

The following provides an indicator of how I set up Forward Runs, Through Balls, Crossing & Passing Focus.

#### Forward Runs

Attack: Often FCs, AMC, ML/R. Mixed FBs, DMC. Rarely DCs

Possession: Often FCs, AMC. Mixed ML/R, FBs. Rarely DMC, DCs

Defend Lead: Often FCs, AMC. Mixed ML/R. Rarely FBs, DMC, DCs.

#### Try Through Balls

Often: FCd, AMC, DMC. Mixed: FCa, ML/R, FBs, DCs, GK

#### Crossing

Often: ML/R, FBs. Mixed: FCs. Rarely: AMC (unless free role), DMC, DCs

#### Focus Passing

Home: Mixed. This provides greater scope and opportunity for attacking moves.

Away: Down Both Flanks: Exploits the channels and keeps the ball away from positions from which interceptions will be costly.

### Hold Up Ball

At least two players should hold up the ball. I usually use my DMC and FCd in these roles, as the DMC holding the ball allows the defence to regroup and the FCd allows for the chance of wingers overlapping him which opens up more attacking angles.

### Marking

In my opinion man-marking was horribly flawed in FM06. It worked perfectly until the AI switched tactics. Once that happened user defenders remained assigned to their original markee no matter where he was repositioned. Therefore, your DC may well end up man-marking the opposition’s ML. I believe this may have been fixed in ’07, although don’t quote me. Anyway, to combat this perceived problem I advise the following.

Tight-Zonal: DCs, FBs, DMC

Loose-Zonal: ML/R, AMC, FCs

This system fits nicely with the CD/CF set up in that it ensure space for front players whilst keeps the defenders tight on their men. For a more defensive system the ML/Rs could also be pushed into tight-zonal.

### Goalkeeper

I have always employed Cleon's classic sweeper-keeper with a mentality of 14 with low CF/CD, although there is no reason you shouldn’t follow general RoT settings and have the keeper’s mentality set to 4.
