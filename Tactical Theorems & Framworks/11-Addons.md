# Tactical Theorems and Frameworks '06

## Addons

### Frameworks and Multi-Tactics

The mentality frameworks are the base settings for all tactics. However, to get the best out of the RoT systems you will need to build at least two tactics, one home and one away. When you have had a lot of success you will start having to employ the home tactic almost exclusively, but, until then, you will need to pick and choose between systems. In the opening post there are differences in the theorums section that must be applied between home and away systems. Playing a home system only, with a low manager reputation and a poorish side, will get you sacked. I would advise building three tactics, a home, a counter-attacking, and a shut up shop. Pick the right one depending on opposition and the results will start to fly in.

### CD/CF

My CD/CF splits are based on the home/high closing down tactic. The CF can be regarded as standard for all tactics, but CD needs to be switched between home and away. High CD works against negative formations, low CD works against attacking formations. If you use high CD while playing a quality side away you will struggle. As for high CD attackers away from home; it may be a great idea and I know Rashidi has it working well. I don't use it but would love to hear about successful tests.

### Counter-Attack

I didn't make it clear, but counter-attack should be ticked for away formations. It is counter-intuitive in that it doesn't mean your team will look to break at every opportunity, but, they will balance attacks between risk and reward, so won't go forward unless more obvious chances present.

### Run With Ball

I also forgot to mention this. It is basically fairly intuitive. At home you can allow anybody, minus the DCs, freedom to run with the ball as long as they have the right stats. For away games, tone it down for the FBs and DMC.

### Notes

It's interesting to see that a long-time RoTer (crazy gra) is having a similar degree of success in '07 as '06. The key for me is understanding when to do what, and because of the sheer volume of information I have written, that can be difficult. Key things to remember:

1: Build a home and away system, no matter which team you are managing. I generally used three systems, a standard home and two away tactics, a 4-2-3-1 which was quite counter-attacking with the wingers and the AMC, FC getting forward, and a more defensive 4-4-2 Diamond, which generally countered through the sarrowed FCs. I only began to employ the Ultra-Attacking as a system to counter the 3-3-2-1-1, so use it with care.

2: Because you have a poor reputation a lot of sides will attack you more than you may expect, so early on in the game, defensive or possession based tactics may be more effective.

3: Use excessive Time Wasting with caution, as its effectiveness has been toned down for '07. My 15-5 split may not work any more, so be careful.

4: High CF should ONLY be employed for the front 3. I have six players on CF of 5 or less (GK, DCs (3), FBs 5), DMC,MCd (5)), two on 10 (ML/R) and only three on 15 (MCa/AMC & FCs). High CF across the board DOES NOT work. CF is consistent home and away, no matter how you decide to employ CD.

5: Marking. I only advocate tight marking with the back 5, not across the board. It seems there may still be issues with man-marking, so be careful.

### Attacking Systems

This is where my ability to give decent advice begins to come unstuck as I still can't play the game. It took me a fair few seasons to start coping with the more defensive systems in the game, with a lot of testing and tweaking. However, I'll attempt to offer a few theoretical hints and tips and see where that gets you.

### Closing Down & Defensive Line

I used to have my d-line at 10 for more attacking systems with a CD of 17/15 for the DCs/FBs. Asmo suggests that d-line influence has changed between '06 and '07, so dropping it to 5 or so may work. This will spread the play out and give your players more time and space on the ball to make quality passes. You may well add CD to the MCd/DMC too so he pressures the opposing FC as soon as he gets the ball.

In '06, I used Asmo's d-line/mentality matching concept to build a solid defence. The premise was that the d-line should be set to the same mentality as your most attacking midfielder. That way the formation remained compact and there weren't too many gaps between defence and midfield. This theory needed a few revisions in '06.

Revision One: DMC

I found that if you used a DMC then a high defensive line became a liability. The DMC got dragged into the back four and allowed the opposing midfielders too much time and space to thread balls into the penalty area. Reducing the defensive line by two notches seemed to correct this problem.

Revision Two: Breaking Down the 3-3-2-1-1

I found that a high d-line became problematic when playing teams who sat back. The problem was that the defenders were put under pressure too quickly when picking up clearances from the AI, which meant they couldn't recycle possession. Dropping it by another 4 notches led to the DCs being in lots of space when picking up loose balls and allowed them to hold possession until the attack reorganised.

### Closing Down & FCs

Upping the closing down for your FCs may work as it will force more hurried clearances from the AI. I haven't tried it myself, but it would be well worth testing.

### Width & Tempo

Early '07 testing suggested a 15/15 split was the way to go here. It may be that you need to play a more possession friendly game against defensive systems, so 15/5, or 17/3, could work. I had a lot of success with the 15/5 in '06, but tweaking it further may work wonders.

### Tight-Marking

Reduce tight-marking settings so only the DCs are employing it. This will give your other players more space and time. Alternatively, against a 4-5-1 system, specific mark the opposing FC with your MCd, which allows the DCs to pick up the ball in space and start new attacks.

### Forward Runs

Could be well worth making the FBs FR often to provide more overlaps.

### Through Balls & Crossing

In '06 I had everyone playing through balls to mixed and it proved very successful. It may be worth toning it down for the DCs and GK against defensive sides, so they focus on easy lay offs that keep possession and allow more creative players more opportunity to play killer balls. FBs should have mixed TB and Crossing, ML/R mixed TB, often Crossing.

### Time Wasting

If, as suggested, its influence has been increased, reduce from 5 to 3.

### Half Time Team Talks

If your side isn't performing as expected in may be worth while throwing a few tea cups at half time to knock them out of their stupor! They should be beating poor sides, so make sure they know it.

### Scoring Goals

In '06, the long-farrowed wingers and short-farrowed FB system produced chance after chance, as the combination worked space on the flanks, so each cross was delivered with very little pressure on the crosser. As four players were attacking the ball in the box, the FCs, the AMC and the other winger, one invariably got on the end of it. It was a very satisfying way to score, and a little tweaking should recreate this in '07.

### Possession

I need to know possession stats for matches against defensive systems. You should, at half-time, be leading possession 55%-45%. If not, something is going very wrong. If you can tweak the tactic towards achieving that figure against poorer sides then you will start seeing results.

Holding possession may need breaking down some of the theories a little, but in general:

1. Slow the tempo down. A slower tempo equals better quality passing. In '06, i used to use a tempo of 5 and would regularly see possession of >55%.

2. Experiment with passing i.e. breaking the passing/mentality link. Giving the DCs shorter passing should help in possession.

3. Higher time wasting generally means more possession, so be wary of the fact that possessiob stats reflect this. Your possession may all be quality, whereas theirs may be deep and defensive.

4. Closing Down. Follow Rashidi's ideas on closing down with the front men (page 3) and you should force the Ai into hurrying passes.

### Width

Simply, wide is for more aggressive systems, narrow for more defensive. Decide which type of system you wish to play and alter width accordingly.

### Target Man

Limits attacking options against poor sides so don't use it.

### Playmaker

Likewise.

### Focus Passing

Mixed to open up a multitude of angles. This is why I used to give all players TTBs, as an attacking pass could come from anywhere at any time.
